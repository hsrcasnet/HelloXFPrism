Prism is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications in WPF, and Xamarin Forms. The sample app in this repository demonstrates the use of Prism in a very basic Xamarin Forms app.

It covers topics such as:
- MVVM data binding between Views and ViewModels
- Commanding between Views and ViewModels
- Event aggregation for loosely coupled communication between ViewModels
- Navigation with MVVM support
